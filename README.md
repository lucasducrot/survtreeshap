# SurvTreeSHAP

**SurvTreeSHAP** is a Python package for interpreting tree-based survival models at scale. It extends SurvSHAP(t) explanations addressing the computational bottlenecks with the TreeSHAP algorithm. It takes advantage of the tree structure and provide fast and scalable survival prediction explanations in high-dimensional settings.


## ðŸ“¦ Supported Models

- `scikit-survival` Random Survival Forests (`RandomSurvivalForest`)
- `xgboost` or `lightgbm` survival models with appropriate loss functions

## ðŸ’¡ Example Usage

See examples in jupyter notebooks for simulations and real dataset GBSG
